            I studied art history and contemporary art theory, and worked with various artists and art organisations. 
            Now, I want to play with the Internet and gaming, as they have been my inspiration since I was born.
            I'm currently based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. I speak Japanese, English and German. Yep, I'm Japanese.
