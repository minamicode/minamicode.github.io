                I studied art history and contemporary art theory, and
                previously worked with various artists and art organisations.
                I'm based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, and speak Japanese, English
                and German. Other than that, I love gaming!<br>

                I love gaming so much that I want to make games by myself. I'mcurrently learning to code, and looking for work to learn how to
                build a software with JavaScript.<br>
