            I studied art history and contemporary art theory, and previously worked with various artists and art organisations. I'm based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, and speak Japanese, English and German. Other than that, I love gaming!<br>

            I love gaming so much that I want to make one (or two) by myself. For that, I'm currently learning to code, and looking for work to learn how to build a software with JavaScript.<br>
